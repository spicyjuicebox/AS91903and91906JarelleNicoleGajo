        <h2>WHO ARE WE AND WHAT DO WE DO?</h2>
        <p>Hello! Here at Sancta Maria College, the tuckshop team would like to present the SMC Tuckshop website.</p>
        <p>This will be useful for students to make quick and easy online food orders that will simply be picked up at the tuckshop so that they can make more use of their time during lunch and interval.</p>
        <p>This will reduce the time you have to wait in long tuck shop lines.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about the tuckshop or suggestions you think would improve the tuckshop, leave a post in the 'Q&A + Suggestions' page!</p>
        <p>If you would like to contact the head of tuckshop or our team, head to the 'Contact' page.</p>
